            Hello It's me best programmer in the whole world.
            Today you're gonna learn how did I became this giga-chad of a programmer.
            First you need to know my origin story.
            One time on a sunday afternoon I was playing one of my favourite games "Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice" and a thought came to my mind.
            How did FromSoftware develop this fantastic game.
            I started with Unity didn't like it, so I started learning HTML5 and CSS3.
            Developed some HTML web pages felt like I know something, then the realisation came,that I don't know nothing.
            Then started learning JavaScript.
            Fell in love with it.
            Of course it had it's problems but I loved it.
            Although I didn't write really much of JavaScript in the Blog but I liked doing it.
